Call for Speakers
-----------------

Python.Ph is now looking for speakers for our PyCon Philippines 2015 to be held
at Ateneo Manila, on July 4-5, 2015.

Why Participate?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rapidly growing Python audience
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Python is growing fast in the Philippines. Last year, we had a record of over
200 Pythonistas attend PyCon, ranging from complete beginners to experts. By
speaking at PyCon, you can become part of the Python culture.

A celebration of Python
"""""""""""""""""""""""

PyCon is a celebration of the Python language and every year, we gather speakers
that will honor and showcase the language.

Friendly community
""""""""""""""""""

Python.Ph have only hosted two PyCon. However, you'll find a friendly core of
participants who always seem to return. So we are probably doing something
right. These people are also unbelievably nice, as evidenced by all the smiles
on our photos.

Our community is so friendly, that passionate and enthusiastic newcomers become
even more passionate and enthusiastic with Python that they assimilate into our
community. They have started spreading the Python around.

As a speaker, you will have a chance to talk in front of the charming PyCon
participants.

Driving forward as a Python Pioneer
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Speaking to a large audience is hard work. But in exchange, you'll gain
reputation amongst your peers as a credible Python speaker.

You will also help establish Python's reputation in the Philippines. Who knows,
maybe one of your peers would become surprised that you were one of the
pioneers of Python.

Learning experience
"""""""""""""""""""

Its not everyday that you will have a chance to speak to over 200 people that
came from around the Philippines and the World. You will make mistakes. You will
be pressured. BUT you will learn something. And you will learn lessons not only
from your presentation, you will also learn from the other speakers.

Speaker benefits
""""""""""""""""

As a speaker, you will be invited to dinner with other speakers, the PyCon
volunteers and the organizers. This will be great time to rest up, network, meet
new friends, and most important of all: eat.

Presentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our theme this year is "Work and Play with Python". Your presentation should be
structured around this theme.

Send us an abstract, a short description and the title of your
proposed talk. Your talk should be a maximum of 55 minutes.

The deadline for submission of presentations will be on May 31, 2015.

Workshops
^^^^^^^^^

We also hold workshops during PyCon Philippines. We traditionally have two
workshops: Beginner Python and Django. Both of these workshops lasts 4 hours.

If you would like to host a workshop, please send us an abstract,
level of difficulty and running time for your workshop. We will then contact
you for a practice session so we can evaluate your material.

The deadline for submission of workshop proposals will be on May 15, 2015.

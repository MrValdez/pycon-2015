This year, our theme will be "Work and Play with Python".

Python can be found in the workspace. It has been used to make small scripts to
assist the workflow, or to make commercial applications that are sold for
profit. Python can be found in play. It has been used to make fun scripts, or
even to scratch the artistic curiosity.

This year, we will celebrate the use of Python in work and in play.

Past PyCons
===========

2014
----

PyCon 2014 was held at De La Salle University on February
22-23. It was the second Philippines PyCon and the first PyCon
hosted after the establishment (todo: word choice) of Python.ph.

PyCon 2014 was a huge success with attendees from around the
Philippines. PyCon 2014 also paid respect to Malcolm Tredinnick,
a PyCon 2012 speaker, who unexpectedly passed away and left a
hole in the Python Community. Our keynote speaker, Russell
Keith-Magee from Django Software Foundation, shared stories
about Malcolm's accomplishments.

2012
----

The first Python Conference in the Philippines was held last June 30 to July 1
2012 in UP Diliman. Spearheaded by Frank and Ann Pohlmann of Auberon Solutions,
it was a huge success in spite of a short amount of time we had for the
preparation. The conference was graced upon representatives from the Python
Software Foundation (PSF) and a turnout of roughly 240 students and
professionals across the country. It was truly an inspiring event with a
diverse audience and a distinct spirit of volunteerism that made it happen.

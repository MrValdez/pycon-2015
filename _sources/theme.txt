Theme
=====

This year, our theme will be "Work and Play with Python".

There are many ways to use Python. At work, it has been used to make scripts to
assist the workflow and to make commercial applications. At play, it has been
used to scratch the creative itch.

Our talks will revolve around the ideas of using Python for working and playing.
